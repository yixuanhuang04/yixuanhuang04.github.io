    <h1>Beyond Academia</h1>

    <p>Welcome to this space where I share the side of me beyond research. Life is more than achievements—it's the small
        moments, passions, and connections that shape our perspectives and identities. Here, I go deeper into what makes
        me who I am, the experiences that inspire me, and the reflections that accompany my journey.</p>

    <p>Just as I have said on the main page, beyond research and academia, there are countless things that shape who I
        am. Both my academic activities and the seemingly ordinary yet unique experiences of daily life contribute to my
        growth and identity. I am truly grateful that you are willing to explore this part of me, to see beyond the
        academic façade and understand me more fully.</p>

    <p>While academic homepages often highlight achievements and milestones, I also wish to record the ordinary yet
        memorable moments that make life meaningful. These experiences may appear unrelated to academia, but to me, they
        are essential in shaping the person I am becoming—someone devoted to both scholarship and life itself. This
        section is, in a way, my personal memoir. One day, when I look back, I hope to not only see my academic
        accomplishments but also the path I have walked, step by step, to reach them.</p>

    <p>I once read a line that deeply moved me: “If my story can be remembered by one more person, I have lived one more
        life.” Perhaps when I revisit this page many years from now, I will find that I was not the most accomplished
        academic. But I will be someone who kept trying new things, embraced curiosity, shared experiences, enjoyed
        life, and created beautiful memories along the way.</p>

    <p>I love experiencing life in all its forms. Traveling brings me joy—whether it is walking through vibrant cities
        to feel the pulse of local culture, or wandering in the countryside to appreciate the uniqueness of each
        landscape. I also enjoy learning across disciplines, from astronomy and biology to literature and the arts.
        These explorations enrich my life and often spark inspirations that echo back into my academic journey.</p>

    <p>And so, I sincerely invite you to join me—not only in my academic pursuits but also in the everyday moments that
        shape who I am. By reading this, you have already become a part of my story. Perhaps fate has brought us
        together, weaving our paths into something meaningful. Maybe one day we will meet at a conference, share an
        afternoon tea, exchange fresh ideas, and create something exciting together. Or perhaps we will simply become
        friends—traveling, learning, and witnessing the growth of our time side by side.</p>

    <p><em>“朝暮与年岁并往，然后一同与你行至天光。”<br>
            From dawn to dusk, through the passing years, I wish to walk with you toward the light.</em></p>
