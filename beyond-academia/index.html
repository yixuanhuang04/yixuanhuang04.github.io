                        <h1>Beyond Academia</h1>

                        <p>Welcome to this space where I share the side of me that exists beyond research. Life, after
                            all, is more than achievements—it is the small moments, the passions, and the quiet
                            connections that shape who we are. Here, I hope to open a window into what makes me myself:
                            the experiences that inspire me, and the reflections that accompany my journey.</p>

                        <p>Beyond research and academia, there are countless things that form the tapestry of my life.
                            My academic activities matter deeply, yet it is the seemingly ordinary, unique fragments of
                            daily life that contribute just as much to my growth and identity. I am grateful that you
                            are willing to explore this part of me, to look past the academic façade and see a fuller
                            picture of who I am.</p>

                        <p>Academic homepages often highlight milestones and accomplishments, but I long to record
                            something more—the ordinary yet memorable moments that give life its meaning. These
                            fragments may appear unrelated to academia, but for me, they are essential in shaping the
                            person I am becoming: someone devoted not only to scholarship, but also to life itself. This
                            section is, in a sense, a personal memoir. One day, when I look back, I hope I will not only
                            see a list of achievements, but also the path I have walked, step by step, to reach them.
                        </p>

                        <p>I once read a line that has never left me: “If my story can be remembered by one more person,
                            I have lived one more life.” Perhaps, when I revisit this page years from now, I will find
                            that I was not the most accomplished academic. But I will see someone who kept trying, who
                            embraced curiosity, who cherished moments, who shared experiences, who enjoyed life, and who
                            created memories that will always remain.</p>

                        <p>I love experiencing life in all its forms. Traveling brings me joy—whether walking through
                            vibrant cities to feel the rhythm of local culture, or wandering in the countryside to
                            discover the uniqueness of each landscape. I also find delight in learning across
                            disciplines, from astronomy and biology to literature and the arts. These explorations not
                            only enrich my days, but often bring unexpected sparks of inspiration that ripple back into
                            my academic journey.</p>

                        <p>And so, I warmly invite you to join me—not only in my academic pursuits, but also in the
                            everyday moments that shape who I am. By reading this, you have already become part of my
                            story. Perhaps fate has brought us together, weaving our paths into something meaningful.
                            Maybe one day we will meet at a conference, share an afternoon tea, exchange fresh ideas,
                            and create something exciting together. Or perhaps we will simply become friends—traveling,
                            learning, and witnessing the growth of our time side by side.</p>

                        <p>In the end, as a blessing and a promise, I leave you these words:</p>

                        <p><em>“朝暮与年岁并往，然后一同与你行至天光。”</em><br>
                            <em>— <b>As dawn and dusk travel along with the years, walk with you, together into the light.</b></em>
