Hello! My name is Yixuan Huang, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University of Technology, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I’ve always had a deep passion for robotics and its intersection with artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like decision-making, and multi-agent systems.

As I move closer to the end of my undergraduate studies, I am more eager than ever to begin engaging in research. I am highly motivated to explore the complexities of robotics, from autonomous decision-making and motion planning to human-robot interaction and lifelong learning. I believe that scientific research is where I can make a real impact and develop the skills that will serve me throughout my career.

I am actively looking for opportunities to join research teams where I can contribute, learn, and grow. I’m particularly interested in applying my academic background in robotics, algorithms, and machine learning to practical problems in the field, and I am excited to collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for advancing robotics.

Starting my journey into research is something I’m truly excited about, and I’m committed to dedicating my time and energy to it. If you share similar interests or are working on projects that align with my passions, I’d love to connect and explore potential collaborations.

## Experience

**China College Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition** - Provincial First Prize, Ranked 2nd Nationwide

*Date: Jun. 2023 – Oct. 2023*

- Led a team to design a simulated intelligent connected vehicle, capable of intelligently assessing road conditions and making driving decisions.
- Managed the overall project, ensuring smooth coordination and task delegation among team members.
- Developed and coded algorithms for vehicle decision-making in the simulation environment, optimizing for real-time performance and safety (scored 30% higher than the next team).

**Electronic Music Box** – Electrical Engineering and Electronics Coursework

*Date: Oct. 2023 – Nov. 2023*

- Designed and fabricated an electronic music box that mimics the appearance of a vinyl record player, featuring music and light circuits, with a fully designed PCB layout created using *Altium Designer*.
- Assembled the final product by soldering components and conducting circuit functionality testing.
- Successfully implemented a system that allows users to freely select songs stored on a memory chip, with the number of songs limited by the chip's storage capacity and the space required for each individual song.

**Electronic Keyboard** – Analog Electronic Circuit Coursework

*Date: Nov. 2023 – Dec. 2023*

- Designed and built a simple electronic keyboard with 21 keys, each generating a corresponding tone from *C3* to *B5* in the Scientific Pitch Notation when pressed.
- Developed a driving circuit to control a buzzer for sound output, utilizing basic electronic components like resistors, capacitors, and transistors.
- Implemented an oscillator circuit to produce specific frequencies for each keypress, I have played multiple musical pieces using the electronic keyboard.

**Multi-Functional Quiz Buzzer System** – Digital Circuits Design Coursework

*Date: May. 2024 – Jun. 2024*

- Designed and implemented an 8-channel quiz buzzer system with a countdown timer, using digital circuits, including logic gates and flip-flops.
- Built a pure hardware circuit to detect buzzer inputs and determine the number of the first participant to press their button, controlling both an LED display and seven-segment displays.
- I used this buzzer system in a classroom quiz competition.

**Electronic Password Lock System** - Microcontroller Applications Coursework

*Date: Nov. 2024 – Dec. 2024*

- Designed and implemented an electronic password lock system using FPGA for secure access control.
- The system includes features such as password validation, error password alerts, unauthorized access alarms, and password modification, et al.
- Due to FPGA button limitations, the system can support up to $(2^8)^4$ password combinations. This system was integrated into an electronic music box to ensure that the playback content cannot be modified without correct access.
