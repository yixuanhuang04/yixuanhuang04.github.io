Hello! My name is Yixuan Huang, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University of Technology, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I am deeply interested in robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly in studying how robotic agents can perceive, reason, and interact with the world in a human-like and robust manner.

## Experience

**China College Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition** - Provincial First Prize, Ranked 2nd Nationwide

- Led the development of a simulated intelligent connected vehicle, enabling autonomous road condition assessment and decision-making.
- Designed and implemented adaptive algorithms for dynamic environment perception and real-time driving adjustments, surpassing traditional DIP control in human-like behavior simulation.
- Optimized lane-changing strategies, improving smoothness and safety over linear interpolation and fixed-length path generation methods.
- Enhanced decision-making models, integrating high-precision mapping and dynamic traffic adaptation, outperforming static map detection and basic traffic light-based approaches.
- Achieved top performance, scoring 30% higher than the next best team in evaluations.

**Pathology Slide Classification & LLM Distillation**

- Developed a CNN and ResNet18 pipeline to perform automatic classification of pathology slides, achieving balanced slide-level accuracy above 80% on multiple tasks.
- Designed and executed a model distillation workflow: fine-tuned a large language model using slide-level metadata, achieving efficient transfer of contextual slide features to downstream classification tasks.

**Electronic Music Box**

- Designed and fabricated an electronic music box that mimics the appearance of a vinyl record player, featuring music and light circuits, with a fully designed PCB layout created using *Altium Designer*.
- Used periodic oscillation circuit to excite the light.
- Successfully implemented a system that allows users to freely select songs stored on a memory chip.

**Electronic Keyboard**

- Designed and built a simple electronic keyboard with 21 keys, each generating a corresponding tone from *C3* to *B5* in the Scientific Pitch Notation when pressed.
- Developed an electronic keyboard to analyze frequency synthesis using digital signal processing techniques, exploring waveform generation and harmonics tuning for optimal sound quality.
- Played multiple musical pieces using the electronic keyboard.

**Multi-Functional Quiz Buzzer System**

- Designed and implemented an 8-channel quiz buzzer system with a countdown timer, using digital circuits, including logic gates and flip-flops.
- Used state machine planning to make decisions and prioritize.
- Used this buzzer system in a classroom quiz competition and it worked well.

**Electronic Password Lock System** - Microcontroller Applications Coursework

- Designed and implemented an electronic password lock system using FPGA for secure access control.
- Used multi-state federation management.
