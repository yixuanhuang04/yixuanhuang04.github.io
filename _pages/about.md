Hello! My name is Yixuan Huang, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University of Technology, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I’ve always had a deep passion for robotics and its intersection with artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like decision-making, and multi-agent systems.

As I move closer to the end of my undergraduate studies, I am more eager than ever to begin engaging in research. I am highly motivated to explore the complexities of robotics, from autonomous decision-making and motion planning to human-robot interaction and lifelong learning. I believe that scientific research is where I can make a real impact and develop the skills that will serve me throughout my career.

I am actively looking for opportunities to join research teams where I can contribute, learn, and grow. I’m particularly interested in applying my academic background in robotics, algorithms, and machine learning to practical problems in the field, and I am excited to collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for advancing robotics.

Starting my journey into research is something I’m truly excited about, and I’m committed to dedicating my time and energy to it. If you share similar interests or are working on projects that align with my passions, I’d love to connect and explore potential collaborations.
