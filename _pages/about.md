I am Yixuan Huang, a third-year undergraduate student studying Electronic Information Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology. I have a strong passion for research and am actively seeking remote research opportunities in the field of robotics.

With a deep interest in how robotic systems and autonomous technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems, I am driven to explore and contribute to advancements in this area. My academic journey so far has provided me with a solid foundation in electronic circuits, signal processing, and programming, which I am eager to apply to cutting-edge research projects.

As an enthusiastic learner, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and collaborate with like-minded researchers. I am particularly excited by the potential of robotics to transform industries and everyday life, and I am motivated to contribute to this transformative field through hands-on research and development.

I am looking for research projects where I can contribute to innovation, expand my technical skills, and engage with a community of researchers who share my passion for robotics and autonomous systems. Welcome to  email me to discuss potential research collaborations or opportunities.
