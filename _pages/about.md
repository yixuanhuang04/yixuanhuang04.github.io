Hello! My name is Yixuan Huang(黄亦轩), and I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University of Technology, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I am deeply interested in robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly in studying how robotic agents can perceive, reason, and interact with the world in a human-like and robust manner.

Specifically, I am interested in how to let robots learn autonomously from the feedback of the physical world or cooperation with humans, and complete complex manipulation tasks more robustly, reliably, and safely. I think this is the basic means for robots to interact with the physical world, and it is also a very important content. Similar applications include household robots, cargo transportation robots, etc. At the same time, I am also interested in issues such as navigation, which is the basis for robots to move and interact in physical time or human society. Similar applications include autonomous driving, etc.

I am looking for research internship opportunities. If you are looking to recruit a research assistant or intern, please contact yixuanhm@gmail.com. I look forward to potential collaboration with you!

- Achieved top performance, scoring 30% higher than the next best team in evaluatio.

## Project

**Handwritten Chinese Sentence Recognition using RNN-CTC**

- Designed and implemented an end-to-end handwritten Chinese text recognition system capable of identifying full sentences of variable lengths from grayscale stroke-based images.
- Built a CRNN architecture integrating convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction and bidirectional LSTMs for sequential modeling, followed by a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) decoding layer to enable alignment-free sequence prediction.
- Processed raw `.dgrl` handwritten data files from the CASIA-HWDB dataset, implemented stroke-to-image rendering and vocabulary construction for over 3,700 Chinese characters.
- Achieved strong performance on the test set with **92.6% character accuracy** and **78.4% sentence accuracy**, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline on unconstrained handwritten text input.

**Pathology Slide Classification & LLM Distillation**

- Developed a CNN and ResNet18 pipeline to perform automatic classification of pathology slides, achieving balanced slide-level accuracy above 80% on multiple tasks.
- Designed and executed a model distillation workflow: fine-tuned a large language model using slide-level metadata, achieving efficient transfer of contextual slide features to downstream classification tasks.

**Electronic Music Box**

- Designed and fabricated an electronic music box that mimics the appearance of a vinyl record player, featuring music and light circuits, with a fully designed PCB layout created using *Altium Designer*.
- Used periodic oscillation circuit to excite the light.
- Successfully implemented a system that allows users to freely select songs stored on a memory chip.

**Electronic Keyboard**

- Designed and built a simple electronic keyboard with 21 keys, each generating a corresponding tone from *C3* to *B5* in the Scientific Pitch Notation when pressed.
- Developed an electronic keyboard to analyze frequency synthesis using digital signal processing techniques, exploring waveform generation and harmonics tuning for optimal sound quality.
- Played multiple musical pieces using the electronic keyboard.

**Multi-Functional Quiz Buzzer System**

- Designed and implemented an 8-channel quiz buzzer system with a countdown timer, using digital circuits, including logic gates and flip-flops.
- Used state machine planning to make decisions and prioritize.
- Used this buzzer system in a classroom quiz competition and it worked well.

**Electronic Password Lock System** - Microcontroller Applications Coursework
